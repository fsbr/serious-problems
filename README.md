This repository contains a list of ``serious" problems that I think someone should be workign on.

1.  Instant projector.  So basically one thing that seriously upsets me is that when I'm teaching or presenting, i just stand in front of the group like hi my projector doesn't work. so just sit there and talk amoungst yourselves.  Basically the way this product would work is that the image will basically instantly appear out of the projector without even really having to interact with it at all.

2. Another thing, wentworth still has areas and buildings that look honestly pretty dismal.  For instance, almost all of Annex, top two floors of wentworth hall.  There's not enough feeling like we're in the future.  Wentworth should honestly truly be like living several years in the future of the outside world, and I think we have acceess to the minds and resources that can make this positive change to the school.  There's one project that really stands out to me in terms of achieveing that, which is the library automated art project (can't remember the formal name)

The other project that is really contributing in this area is the shake table made in ELMC.  The basic change that I want to see in this area is having multiple year senior projects.  So like some guys make a project for one year and then that mantle is taken up by the next years seniors, and in that way you can really get some serious engineering done.  We want to have senior projects be done in the context of serious engineering, not just have the terminal aspect of the project be ``oh this is just a senior project level project".  That's where morphing wing ended and why we got basically owned at the IMECE.    

3.  It's my hope that ADCS is one of those projects that makes  WIT very futuristic. There's a couple more I can think of but when I go to the senior projects I want to make sure that I'm scouting out various ones that are going to be contributing to this idea that like, it's gonna be contributing to the future of the institute.

4.  There is no easy way to map custom key bindings on all 3 operating systems for laptop keyboard. I'll add more when I think of it.

5.  Last thing I want to write in here is that there's basically no real reason at this exact moment in time that we can't compete with the other institute of technology.  We don't have all the same amounts of money but everyone loves an underdog story ;]

6.  When we're here at WIT, what we need to think, is ``what would the future look like" and then come up with clear plans taht are going to make the present moment look like that.  So for example, I think there should be more flashy robots at WIT, well, we're working on making that happen.  There's other changes too but basically, uhhh yah.
